# Designs & Templates

A repo for web designs & templates I have created. All designs were created in photoshop, which were converted into responsive templates using (for the most part) vanilla html/css/js. The goal here was to get very familiar with the fundamentals, so that other technologies built upon these would come easier. The .psd's can be found in each respective design folder along with the html and css for reference.
